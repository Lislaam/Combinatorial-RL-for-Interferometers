Work I am doing for my MPhys project "Combinatorial Optimisation on Graphs for Science Operations in Radio Astronomy"

I wrote all this code independently, but the wider project was completed alongside Aavash Subedi and supervised by Professor Anna Scaife. You can see how this code fits into our wider investigation here: https://github.com/aavashsubedi/masters_project
